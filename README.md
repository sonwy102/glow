# Glow

Glow is a web application that tracks a user's personalized skincare routine 
and skin health goals.

## Project Background

For many of us, skin health is a journey. Our skin is resilient - it grows, 
changes, and adapts over time based on many factors surrounding us. And they are 
not easy to point out when things go wrong. Was it from a moisturizer I used? 
Maybe something in the sunscreen I started last week? Did I eat too much dairy 
the past few days?

Glow is a simple yet comprehensive way to track your skin health over time. 
Although not all skin changes are easily identified by self-monitoring, 
Glow provides a space to recognize patterns and behaviors of our skin over time.
